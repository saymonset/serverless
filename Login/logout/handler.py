    triggered the function. In this case, it likely contains information about the HTTP request that was
    made to the function
    :param context: The `context` parameter is an object that provides information about the runtime
    environment of the function. It includes details such as the AWS request ID, function name, and
    other contextual information. In this code snippet, the `context` parameter is not used, so it can
    be safely ignored

    of 200 and a message indicating that the logout was successful. If the user is not authenticated, it
    returns a response with a status code of 401 and a message indicating that the request is
